# wotc-dungeon-generator

At this time, this work does not belong to me. This is both an educational/interest piece for myself and a digital museum.

I've downloaded [this webpage](https://www.wizards.com/dnd/mapper/launcher.htm) as I'm interested in procedural generation and Wizards of the Coast tend to delete old web content.

However I also intend to modernise this a little one day, extracting multiple files and JS classes for the separate parts, adding build automation, maybe TypeScript, whatever else takes my fancy.

For now you can run the webpage locally.
